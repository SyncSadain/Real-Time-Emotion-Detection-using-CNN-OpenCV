Real-Time Emotion RecognitionReal-Time Emotion Recognition
- Mar 2024


Developed a real-time facial emotion recognition system utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and OpenCV to detect and classify emotions from both images and live video feed.

Technologies Used:

• Programming Languages: Python
• Libraries/Frameworks: TensorFlow/Keras (for CNN), OpenCV (for real-time video processing), NumPy, Pandas
• Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Git/GitHub

Achievements:

• Successfully achieved 75% accuracy in emotion recognition across multiple emotion categories.
• Improved understanding of deep learning, computer vision, and real-time processing techniques.
